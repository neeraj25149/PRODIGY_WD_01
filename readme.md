### Hover preview VsCode extension
It can sometimes be hard to quickly modify templates created by someone else without visual cues, 
so to overcome this I have created a vscode plugin called [Hover Preview](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/Hover-Preview). 

Make sure to check that out.

## Features of Landing page templates
* Responsive.
* Technical SEO optimized (uses correct tags, like h1, h2, section etc)
* Tailwind built in, for rapid development (uses `tw-` prefix to separate tailwind classes)
* Quick customization, change only texts.
* Frontend framework independent: Comes with basic html, css just enough for your perfect landing page, you are free to modify and use any frontend framework (React, Vue) if required.

## Whom is this suitable for?
* Developers who have tight deadlines.
* Freelancers looking to show a prototype or use a template to build faster.
* SaaS Developers who don't want to spend too much time focusing on landing page, but instead want to ship more.
* App developer who wants to have a web landing page. (helps with your SEO game)
* People who are learning HTML, css and JS.
* People looking for inspiration and ideas.

## Why use website templates?
Honestly at the end of the day most client/customer don't care if you 
created your website from scratch or used a template, they just want their
website running/ solve problem as quickly as possible.

Using website templates will save you hours of work, so you can start looking
for clients or dedicate your time elsewhere.


## Installation and setup
Installation and set up is same for almost all the templates

### Downloading the folder
You can use the browsable page to download a specific repo: [https://awesome-landingpages.vercel.app/](https://awesome-landingpages.vercel.app/)

### Cloning the folder you want

To clone a specific repo read this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73254328/15993687)

### Folder structure
Almost all the folder structure is similar to below shown
```
.
â””â”€â”€ Landingpage/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ css/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind-build.css
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tailwind.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
    â””â”€â”€ readme.md
```

### Setting up tailwind
1. If you are planning to modify tailwind you must have node installed.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you don't want devDependencies, Install dependencies from `.package.json` not package.json, as package.json contains additional dev dependencies to help with types

2.Add a file called `tailwind.config.js` (Note: every folder has this file, with theme)
```js
module.exports = {
	prefix: 'tw-',
	important: false,
	content: [
		"./**/*.{html, jsx, js}",
	],
	theme: {
		extend: {},
	},
	plugins: [],
}
```
3. Now add `postcss.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    "postcss-import": {},
    "postcss-simple-vars": {},
    "postcss-nested": {}
  },
}
```
4. You should also have a base tailwind file called `tailwind.css`
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components{
}
```

Also refer the official [tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

> [!NOTE]
**For django developers:**
If you are using Django + tailwind see how to set up in this article: [Adding tailwind to django](https://dev.to/paul_freeman/adding-tailwind-css-to-django-14a)

### Running and building
1. To run the tailwind use `npm run start:tailwind`
2. To build the tailwind use `npm run build:tailwind`

During development add the following to head tag
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tailwind-runtime.css"><!--replace with path to your tailwind runtime-->
```
During production use 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tailwind-build.css"><!--replace with path to your tailwind build-->
```

### Customizing
1. You can start by changing the text.
2. If you want to change the primary color, you can check the `tailwind.config.js` file, it
   contains a primary color, changing that would affect the colors in the page.
3. `index.css` also contains variables and colors for button, input, change that file for changing the
   button colors and more.
